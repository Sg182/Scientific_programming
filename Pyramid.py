 has a volume V = 1/3 Ah and total surface area S = A + 1/2nsl where A is the base area and l the slant height, 
 which may be calculated from the apothem of the base polygon,
a = 1/2s cot (pi/n) as A = 12 nsa and l = sqrt(h^2 + a^2). 
Use these formulas to define a function, pyramid_AV, returning V and S when passed values for n, s and h.'''
